    <p>
        I was born and raised in Yuma,Az which is where i lived until i moved to Chandler,Az in the summer of 2012. Growing up I was bery active and played club soccer which definitely helped shape me into who I am today. After we moved I continued to play for a couple clubs here in Chandler but eventually stopped to focus on school. I attended high school here in Chandler at Hamilton where I later graduated from.
