            <p>
                I was born and raised in Yuma,Az which is where i lived until i moved to Chandler,Az in the summer of
                2012.
                Growing up I was very active and played club soccer which definitely helped shape me into who I am
                today.
                After we moved I continued to play for a couple clubs here in Chandler but eventually stopped to focus
                on
                school. I attended high school here in Chandler at Hamilton where I later graduated from.
